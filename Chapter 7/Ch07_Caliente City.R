# R Challenge: Could this matrix be automatically created from the response time matrix?----
# Read tabular data from the Mac clipboard using the 'pbpaste' command
# 'pipe()' runs a system command and treats the result like a file
# 'pbpaste' outputs the contents of the clipboard
# 'read.table()' reads that output as if it were a regular data table
# 'as.matrix()' converts the data frame to a matrix
f.con <- as.matrix(read.table(pipe("pbpaste")))
# In windows use: my_matrix <- as.matrix(read.table("clipboard"))
f.con

# Set inequality signs
f.dir <- rep(">=", 8)

# Set right hand side parameters
f.par <- rep(1, 8)

# Solve the optimization problem
result <- lp("min", f.obj, f.con, f.dir, f.par, all.bin = TRUE)

# Extract the solution
solution <- result$solution

# Extract the value of the objective function
obj_value <- result$objval

# Print the optimized solution and objective function value
cat("Optimized solution:\n")
print(solution)

cat("Objective function value:", obj_value, "\n")

# In Class Exercise -----
# Optimize this code, so there is no need for calculations outside R environment.
